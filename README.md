# Chatbot-using-dialogflow
This project involves creating a chatbot using Dialogflow for natural language processing and Flask as the backend server. Dialogflow provides the conversational interface for the chatbot, interpreting user input and generating responses. Flask serves as the backend server, handling requests from Dialogflow and generating appropriate responses.

To make the Flask server accessible online, we use ngrok, a tool that creates a secure tunnel to localhost, allowing external access to the server. This enables users to interact with the chatbot from anywhere, not just on the local machine where the server is running.
